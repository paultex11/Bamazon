Setup

First clone this repo to your local directory.

Next, navigate to your repo in your command terminal, and enter:

npm install

This will ensure you have all the necessary NPM packages installed to run this generator.

Next, you will need to run the bamazonSchema.sql file in your SQL IDE of choice. Be sure to have your SQL server of choice running, such as MySQL.

You will likely be prompted for your credentials. Assuming you know your password for the connection, enter them now with host set to localhost or 127.0.0.1, password set to your password, and port set to 3306 or 3307.

Open or paste the contents of the bamazonSchema.sql file in the IDE, and run the script, preferably function by function in order to check possible errors as you go along.

Next, navigate to the bamazonCustomer.js and bamazonManager.js, and in the connection variable (defined at the top of these files), enter in your password in the password property of the object in the ''.

You are now ready to shop or manage Bamazon.

Overview
As mentioned in the video walkthrough, there are two CLI applications, bamazonCustomer.js and bamazonManager.js.

To run them, enter node <your app of choice> and then press enter to access the CLI.
